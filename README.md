TinyViT on CIFAR-10

An end-to-end implementation of a Tiny Vision Transformer (TinyViT) trained from scratch on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This repository is meant to demystify Vision Transformers by breaking down their components clearly and providing a fully functional training + demo pipeline.

🔍 Overview

Vision Transformers (ViTs) apply transformer-based architectures to image data by converting images into sequences of patch embeddings. This project walks through a minimalist ViT architecture with detailed modular design, intuitive explanations, and self-attention visualizations (coming soon).

🧠 Architecture Breakdown

1. Patch Embedding

self.patches_embedding = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=64, kernel_size=4, stride=4)

	•	Input image: 32x32x3
	•	Patch size: 4x4 => total patches: (32/4)^2 = 64
	•	After conv: (B, 64, 8, 8) -> flattened to (B, 64, 64)
	•	Output shape: (Batch, Num_Patches, Embedding_Dim)

Each row is a 64-dimensional embedding for a patch.

2. ViT Embedding: CLS + Positional Embedding

self.cls_token = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, 1, 64))
self.pos_embedding = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, 65, 64))

	•	CLS token is prepended to the sequence.
	•	Output shape: (B, 65, 64)

🔍 Why positional embedding?

Let’s say the embedding says:
	•	Patch has black & white textures = ears.
	•	If it’s in top-left, it might belong to a panda.
	•	If the same patch appears in the bottom, it might be another animal or an upside-down image.

🚀 Positional embeddings help the model understand where the patch came from, not just what it contains.

3. Transformer Encoder Block

nn.LayerNorm -> nn.MultiheadAttention -> Add & Norm -> MLP -> Add & Norm

	•	Q = K = V = normalized input => self-attention
	•	Multi-head attention captures relationships between patches
	•	MLP refines representations

Each block retains the shape: (B, 65, 64)

4. Classification Head

self.mlp_head = nn.Sequential(
  nn.LayerNorm(64),
  nn.Linear(64, 10)
)

	•	Uses only the [CLS] token at index x[:, 0]
	•	Final shape: (B, 10) → class logits

🔍 Attention Map Visualization (Coming Soon)

We’ll visualize how the [CLS] token attends to each image patch using heatmaps.

📈 Performance

Epoch	Train Acc	Val Acc
10	~63.6%	~60.4%

Not state-of-the-art — but the point is educational clarity, not leaderboard scores.

💡 Inspiration

This project was designed from scratch with a goal of fully understanding ViTs — not just using them. Through hands-on debugging and shape-checks, this repo explains:
	•	Why patch tokenization matters
	•	What positional embeddings do
	•	How self-attention interacts with visual data
